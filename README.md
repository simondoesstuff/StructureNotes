# structurenotes

Give your notes structure.

StructureNotes is meant primarily for logging information.
For example, StructureNotes can be used as a powerful check book.
It could be used to track mood or sleep.
Or even lab data.

StructureNotes is a note taking app based on upon giving notes a structure.
Notes are first given a form, outlined as a list of attributes. Attributes
consist of a name and type. Notes can hold multiple entries which each follow
the note's form.

Everything -- including attributes in the note's form... entries... folders...
can be moved around and modified after the note already has existing data
(some limitations).

### Platform

Built primarily for Mobile & Desktop using Flutter.
State is managed with RiverPod.
